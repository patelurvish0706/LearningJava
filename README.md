***Learning JAVA***

This is my java repo that i created to learn and practice Java programming for *DSA*

<ul>
<li>Printing String</li>
• Concating two string variable like Hello + world!!! and print it.<br>
--> HelloWorld!!!
<br><br>

<li>Printing Integer</li>
• Printing sum of two interger like 10 and 20.<br>
--> 10 + 20 = 30
<br><br>

<li>Printing Sting + Integer</li>
• Printing sting with integer that consider whole as a string.<br>
--> HelloWorld!!!1020<br><br>
• Printing integer with string that print operation of strig and for string it consider whole as string.<br>
--> 30HelloWorld!!!
<br><br>

<li>Operation with the same variable</li>
• Adding same variable in that variable with additon.<br>
• here, x = 5 so x = x means x consider 5. then + 5 means adding 5 in exsisting x. so the output is 10.<br>
--> 10
</ul>

<li>Practical 1 : Simple Interest Counter.</li>

The formula for calculating simple interest is:

Simple Interest (SI) = (P * R * T) / 100   

Where:

P is the principal amount (the initial amount borrowed or invested)   
R is the rate of interest per year (expressed as a percentage)   
T is the time period in years   
Example:

If you borrow $1,000 at an annual interest rate of 5% for 3 years, the simple interest would be:

SI = (1000 * 5 * 3) / 100 = $150   

To calculate simple interest, you need to know the principal amount, the interest rate, and the time period.
